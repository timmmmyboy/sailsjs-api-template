/**
* Local environment settings
*
* While you're DEVELOPING your app, this config file should include
* any settings specifically for your development computer (db passwords, etc.)
*
* When you're ready to deploy your app in PRODUCTION, you can always use this file
* for configuration options specific to the server where the app will be deployed.
* But environment variables are usually the best way to handle production settings.
*
* PLEASE NOTE:
*      This file is included in your .gitignore, so if you're using git
*      as a version control solution for your Sails app, keep in mind that
*      this file won't be committed to your repository!
*
*      Good news is, that means you can specify configuration for your local
*      machine in this file without inadvertently committing personal information
*      (like database passwords) to the repo.  Plus, this prevents other members
*      of your team from committing their local configuration changes on top of yours.
*
* For more information, check out:
